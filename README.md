# Patched osu! builds
This repository contains some of the osu! builds that I've patched to fix issues or enable some conditional functionality. Most of these only contain the patched osu!.exe files, so you will need to get the full game copies from Osekai Snapshots. Full installation instructions are included in the downloads.

## April Fools
- b1807 (2011 April Fools) - Nightcore payload will be always active, no matter the system time. [Download](https://github.com/Oreeeee/osu-patched-builds/raw/main/binaries/b1807-patch.7z)
- 2015 April Fools, both stable and cuttingedge - osu!coin stuff is enabled without the need of Bancho. This patch has a bug where it will try to connect to Bancho, but fail all over. [Download](https://github.com/Oreeeee/osu-patched-builds/raw/main/binaries/2015-aprilfools-nobancho.7z)
- 2018 April Fools, beta and cuttingedge (stable is missing from Osekai, it will be patched when it's found) - The spinning osu! logo in main menu and song select payload will be active, no matter the system time.

# Notice
The original osu! game is made by peppy, and I don't claim any ownership of it. I just did some patches, so that these old builds can be easily enjoyed without any issues.
